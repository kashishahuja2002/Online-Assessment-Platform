4. Number of questions in the pool shall be more than questions displayed.✔️

5. Set a time limit for the assessment (individual timer for a question/optional).✔️ 
   
   `The total time limit is of 100 seconds.`

6. Question order shall be shuffled for each candidate appearing.✔️

7. Assessment score shall be generated at the time of submission.✔️

5. Integrate the .jar files available inside the cloned directory in your project.
6. Now just RUN the Project.
7. If everything is done in order then this will open the website in your local machine.


## CI/CD setup
1. Create a GitHub repository. You may initialize it with a README, license, .gitignore
2. Install git via terminal 

   (On Ubuntu you can do `sudo apt-get install git`)
3. Then do a git clone of your repository, or simply download the zip file of your repository from GitHub and extract it.
4. Copy your java project in the new folder created after cloning (its name will be same to that of the repository you cloned).
